# D20 Diviner

I scraped this together mainly to save a little time while determining Rod of Wonder effects while playing D&D with my friends.
After a little while, I started adding more stuff to it.

### Current features

- **Home** view has simple buttons for rolling D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20. It also allows you to add additional rolls to the
result of the first roll.
- **Character sheet** view has my D&D character's info hard-coded in and has a quick-edit feature to allow updating stats, prepared spells, etc.
- **Rod of Wonder** view determines the effect of a D20 roll, and automatically completes any follow-up rolls that effect might require.

### Future features

- I'd like to add a FB/Google sign-on so the character sheet feature is tied to a user account and not hard-coded with my
character's info.
